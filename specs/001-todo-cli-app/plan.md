# Implementation Plan: Todo CLI Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-cli-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: [specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md](../001-todo-cli-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md`

## Summary

A CLI-based Todo application for individual users that manages tasks entirely in memory. The application supports five core operations: add tasks with title and description, view all tasks with completion status, update existing tasks, delete tasks by ID, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The architecture uses a layered approach with clear separation between CLI interface, task storage, and business logic.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (from constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: UV for package management (from constitution), click or argparse for CLI
**Storage**: In-memory only (from constitution, spec FR-003)
**Testing**: pytest (standard for Python projects)
**Target Platform**: CLI (cross-platform via Python)
**Project Type**: Single CLI application
**Performance Goals**: All operations complete within 5 seconds (from spec SC-001)
**Constraints**: In-memory storage only, no persistence, single-user session
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, individual session, minimal task count (personal productivity)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Constitution Rule | Compliance | Evidence |
|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Python 3.13+ | ✅ PASS | Tech stack fixed in Constitution Section 3 |
| UV for environment | ✅ PASS | Constitution specifies UV |
| CLI-only interaction | ✅ PASS | Scope defined as console-based CLI |
| In-memory storage | ✅ PASS | Spec FR-003 requires in-memory only |
| No persistence | ✅ PASS | Constitution excludes file/database persistence |
| No manual coding | ✅ PASS | All implementation via Claude Code |
| Skills enforcement | ✅ PASS | Orchestrator enforces skills from .claude/skills.md |
| Traceability (Task ID required) | ✅ PASS | Implementation will use TASK-XXX format |

**Result**: ALL GATES PASS ✅ - Proceed to Phase 0

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen because:
- CLI-only application with no frontend/backend separation
- Minimal complexity suitable for demonstrating SDD workflow
- Clear separation of concerns: models, storage, CLI layers
- Standard Python project layout compatible with UV

### Complexity Tracking

*Not applicable - no Constitution Check violations*

---

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

No research required. All technical decisions are specified in the constitution:
- Language: Python 3.13+ (fixed)
- Package manager: UV (fixed)
- Storage: In-memory (fixed per spec)
- CLI framework: click or argparse (standard Python options, either acceptable)

---

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

See `data-model.md` for entity definitions.

### CLI Contracts

See `contracts/cli-commands.md` for command specifications.

### Quickstart Guide

See `quickstart.md` for development setup instructions.

## Phase 1 Output Artifacts

The following files are generated by this plan phase:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data-model.md` | Task entity, fields, validation rules, state transitions |
| `contracts/cli-commands.md` | CLI command syntax, arguments, outputs, error messages |
| `quickstart.md` | Setup instructions, development workflow |

---

**Plan Status**: Phase 1 Complete
**Next Command**: `/sp.tasks` to generate executable task list
